  <h1 class="heading">Apps For Buildings</h1>

  <p>
    Apps for Buildings is TEECOM’s foray into the product side of technology for buildings. On the infrastructure side, we’re constantly pushing our clients to look ahead and make choices that will allow for maximum flexibility in the future. But for quite some time, we’ve felt that there exists a significant opportunity to push the state of the art forward on the interface side of things as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    To that end, Apps for Buildings is an opportunity to showcase some of our ideas and turn them into actual products that people can use. As part of our Research Group, this endeavor is very much a work in progress that we hope to grow in the coming months and years. We have several awesome projects in the pipeline…

    Waiting for the next train doesn't do you any good, especially when you could have spent five more minutes polishing tomorrow's presentation. Lobby Transit™ makes it easy to put a public transit display in your building. You'll know exactly when the next train will depart and won't be caught off guard if there are delays.

    TEECOM designs all kinds of conference rooms with all kinds of audiovisual systems. There's no need for the AV control to get in the way of starting a conference call. Room Phone™ streamlines the process so you can take advantage of the audio system in a conference room but use a simple and familiar interface on your own device.
