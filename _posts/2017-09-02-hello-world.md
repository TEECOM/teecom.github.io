Hello, there!

We are a distributed research and development team of (currently) four working
under [TEECOM](https://teecom.com), a Bay Area engineering firm. We plan on
using this space to share our team's insights and successes as we work on our
many fun and exciting projects.  If you would like to learn more about our team, check out our
[team page](/team)!

The title of our blog takes inspiration from Zora Neale Hurston's 1942
autobiography, *Dust Tracks on a Road*, where she writes:

> Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose. It
is a seeking that he who wishes may know the cosmic secrets of the world and
they that dwell therein.
