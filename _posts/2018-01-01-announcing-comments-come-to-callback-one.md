From early on in Callback One's development, it was clear to us that having the
ability to comment on contacts would  be useful, but we also had questions.
How do comments fit in with our Callback One workflow? How do we make comments
unobtrusive?

Well, we think we've answered these questions and are excited to announce that
commenting on contacts is now supported!

Comments are integrated into both global and contact specific activity feeds.
They are designed to stand out in the activity feed, but not distract from a
contact's data or history.

{% capture image_url %}
  {{site.github.url}}/assets/comment-on-callback-one.png
{% endcapture %}

{% include image.html
           url=image_url
           title="Comments on Callback One"
           caption="A contact comment, integrated into the activity feed" %}

For us, commenting is a way to add timestamped, contextual data to a contact
that wouldn't fit nicely into a standard or custom field.

We hope you enjoy the new feature  and, as always, we look forward to your feedback!
