Portland, Oregon is famous for its excellent public transit. When TEECOM
[opened an office in the city in March, 2017](http://teecom.com/teecom-expands-technology-design-services-portland-oregon-office/),
we knew that we wanted to expand
[Lobby Transit](http://labs.teecom.com/lobbytransit/)™,
our free award-winning real-time transit information app, to
incorporate PDX.

Today, we’re proud to announce that we’ve enabled Lobby Transit™
for MAX Light Rail, Portland Streetcar, and WES Commuter Rail. Using an API to
“translate” information from the TriMet Transit Tracker, Lobby Transit™ enables
anyone to display a colorful graphic that tells viewers when the next transit
option will arrive, and alerts riders to delays and emergency notifications.
Choose a background and visual theme that complement your organization’s
branding to make Lobby Transit™ look great in your space.

Lobby Transit™ has been enthusiastically adopted by San Francisco Bay Area
companies (such as [Unity](https://unity3d.com/)) looking for content to fill
their lobby display screens, and we hope it’s adopted by Portland-area firms as
well.
[Lobby Transit™ is free on the iTunes store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lobby-transit/id909461821?mt=8)
and on Apple TV. We’ve also published a complete
[configuration guide](http://labs.teecom.com/lobbytransit/configure)
to help you get Lobby Transit™ up and running for display on large screen
formats.

[TEECOMlabs](http://labs.teecom.com) plans to enable the app for more cities in
the future. Have a request, or a question?
