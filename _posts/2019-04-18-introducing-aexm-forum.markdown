## Introducing the Architecture ex Machina Forum

We're excited to introduce the Architecture ex Machina forum! As we seek to engage professionals from across the industry,
we wanted to create a place where ideas and conversations could easily be shared. The new forum is powered by [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), which will make it easy to build a thriving community.

We've added some topics to get things going but ultimately the success of the community will depend on contributions from you.
As a starting point, we would love to better understand [what you might hope to get out of a group](https://discuss.aexm.ai/t/what-do-you-hope-to-get-out-of-this-group/19) like this. We are also very interested in learning more about the various artificial intelligence and machine learning initiatives underway at other organizations. [What are you working on](https://discuss.aexm.ai/t/show-and-tell-what-are-you-working-on-right-now-with-ai-ml/27) and where do you want this work to go? Finally, we're looking for contributors to help us build something we think would be super cool: [This Building Does Not Exist (.com)](https://discuss.aexm.ai/t/this-building-does-not-exist-com/26). We think a site like this would be a great way to demonstrate the power and potential of machine learning within the AEC industry.
