  <h5>Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Trial by Jury; Applicable Law</h5>

  <p>PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
    IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>

    <p>Any and all claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) between you and Company arising under or related in any way to these Terms must be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis as described in this Arbitration Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.  This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly.  It includes, but is not limited to, all claims and disputes relating to your use of the Mobile App.</p>

    <p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>

    <p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>

    <p>Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to Company should be sent to: 1333 Broadway Ste. 601 Oakland, CA 94612.  Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The arbitrator’s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court or in circumstances where this Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California and the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

    <p>The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.</p>

    <h5>Legal Compliance</h5>

    <p>You represent and warrant that (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (b) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

    <h5>Company Name and Address</h5>

    <p>Company’s contact information for any end-user questions, complaints or claims with respect to Mobile App is support@teecom.com.</p>

    <h5>Indemnification</h5>

    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, release, and hold harmless Company, its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees and agents from all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from (a) any negligent acts, omissions or willful misconduct by you, (b) your use of, or inability to use, the Mobile App, (c) any breach of these Terms by you, and/or (d) your violation of any law or of any rights of any third party.  Company reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Company in asserting any available defenses.  You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Company.  Company will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.  You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of these Terms or your access to the Mobile App.</p>

    <h5>Equitable Remedies</h5>

    <p>You hereby agree that if the terms of this Agreement are not specifically enforced, Company will be irreparably damaged, and therefore you agree that Company shall be entitled, without bond, other security, proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect any of this Agreement, in addition to any other available remedies.</p>

    <h5>Consumer Complaints</h5>

    <p>In accordance with California Civil Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>

    <h5>General</h5>

    <p>The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you without the Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  The Company shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.  The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.  If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  The Terms are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter.</p>
