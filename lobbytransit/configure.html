  <h1>Configuration Guide</h1>
  <p>We've tried to make it as easy as possible to get Lobby Transit up and running quickly, but we know sometimes it helps to have clear and concise instructions to use as a reference. Below, we've outlined the basic steps required to run Lobby Transit on a large display.</p>

  <div class="row marketing">
    <h4>Step-by-step:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><h5>Download:</h5>
        <p>Find Lobby Transit in the App Store by <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lobby-transit/id909461821?mt=8">clicking this link</a>, or searching for Lobby Transit from the App Store app on the iOS device that's going to host your new transit display.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h5>Connect:</h5>
        <p>Connect the iOS device to the appropriate display adaptor that works with your screen. In most cases you'll probably want the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD826ZM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter">Lightning Digital AV Adapter</a> or the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD098ZM/A/apple-digital-av-adapter">Apple 30-pin Digital AV Adapter</a> (though the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD825ZM/A/lightning-to-vga-adapter">Lightning to VGA Adapter</a> will also work)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
        <p> Perhaps this goes without saying, but you'll also want to be sure to connect your iOS device to a power source through the display adaptor so that it can run 24/7.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h5>Configure:</h5>
        <p>Once connected, we recommend disabling the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan">overscan</a> feature of your display. This feature goes by many names depending on the TV manufacturer, but you're looking for a 1:1 ratio of input pixels to screen output. This will ensure Lobby Transit runs at the highest possible resolution.</p>
        <p>On your iOS device, open the Lobby Transit app and choose the transit station you would like to display. If you've purchased the full version of the app, you'll be able to change this setting at any time, but if not, choose carefully as the limited version only allows you to view a single stop.</p>
        <p>We also recommend disabling any push notifications by putting the device into permanent Do Not Disturb mode. Otherwise, you may find extraneous notifications interrupting the full screen display.<p>
        <p>Additionally, depending on where you end up placing the device, you may want to turn on <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202612">Guided Access</a> to prevent unauthorized individuals from modifying the configuration.</p>
        <p>Finally, to take your installation to the next level, consider registering the device with a Mobile Device Management service, like <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/products/systems-manager">Meraki Systems Manager</a>. There are many free and paid alternatives, but any MDM service will allow you to remotely monitor the status of the device hosting Lobby Transit, control OS updates, push out new apps, and act as an enterprise-class Find My iPhone.
      </li>
      <li><h5>Arrange:</h5>
        <p>As a last step, find an appropriate way to mount your iOS device so it doesn't detract from your clean installation. In some cases it may be enough to just rest the device on the display's mount. In other cases you may need to acquire a dedicated mounting solution to keep the device secure.</p>

          <p>Technically, Lobby Transit is capable of displaying content through an <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/appletv">AppleTV</a>, however, we do not recommend this configuration as it tends to be unreliable, requiring frequent manual reconnection.<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">â†©</a></p>
