  <h1 class="heading">Our Team</h1>

  <p>
    It’s impossible to predict the future, but that doesn’t mean you can’t plan
    for it. Our team, TEECOMlabs, is an in-house self-funded research group
    dedicated to testing, developing, and recommending technology that will
    inform <a href="https://teecom.com">TEECOM</a>'s design and engineering
    solutions.
  <p>

  <p>
    TEECOMlabs was born out of the recognition that today’s built environments
    are enlivened not just by hardware, but by software — that they are not just
    infrastructure, but interfaces — and that a true integration of technology
    will change the very nature of our spatial experience. By examining
    big-picture trends, we help our clients make informed choices and build
    resilience for future change.
