  <h3>Room Phone Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how the software mobile application entitled “Room Phone” (the “Mobile App”) that was created by Teecom, Inc., (“Company”, “we”, or “us”) collects, stores, uses, and discloses information from you when you use the Mobile App.  If you do not agree with or are not willing to comply with any portion of this Privacy Policy, do not download or use the Mobile App.</p>

  <h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

  <h5>GENERALLY</h5>
  <p>The Mobile App is a software application for your phone, tablet or other mobile device (each, a “Device”) which enables users to easily control conference room phone systems and equipment (“Conferencing Equipment”).  For example, the Mobile App enables users to add multiple conference rooms, dial contacts from the user’s address book, and manage in-call features such as hold, mute and call volume.  Except for Device Information and Volunteered Information (each as defined below), the Mobile App does not export and we do not collect any information from you or your Device, including, without limitation, your Address Book Information.</p>

  <h5>ADDRESS BOOK INFORMATION</h5>
  <p>The Mobile App includes a “your contacts” feature (the “Address Book Feature”), which may use the phone numbers gathered from your Device’s address book (“Address Book”) to enable users to quickly auto-dial those numbers on Conferencing Equipment.  The Address Book Feature is optional, however, if you choose not to allow the Mobile App to access your Device’s Address Book, then certain features of the Mobile App may not be available.  When you install and launch the Mobile App for the first time, you will be prompted to indicate whether you want to allow the Mobile App to access your  Address Book.  If you elect to allow the Mobile App to access your Address Book, the Mobile App will access the names and phone numbers from your Address Book (“Address Book Information”). The Mobile App does not export Address Book Information from your Device.</p>

  <h5>USAGE INFORMATION</h5>
  <p>The Mobile App collects the certain usage information that is generated by your use of the Mobile App, such as date, time, numbers called, dial-in passwords, duration for each use of the Mobile App (“Usage Information”). The Mobile App also collects certain information related to the Conferencing Equipment it interacts with and controls, such as equipment and system type, IP address, admin username(s) and admin user password(s) (“Settings Information” and together with Usage Information, “Teleconferencing Information”).   The Mobile App uses Teleconferencing Information to connect your Device to and interact with Conferencing Equipment, and to provide you the features of the Mobile App.  The Mobile App stores Teleconferencing Information locally to your Device, and the Company does not collect Teleconferencing Information.</p>

  <h5>DEVICE INFORMATION</h5>
  <p>Company automatically collects the certain information from your Device.  For example, when you use the Mobile App your Device’s operating system, type, Unique User ID (UUID), and wireless carrier for your Device, as well as information about software errors experienced by your Device while using the Mobile App, including the state of your Device at the time of the error (“Device Information”) are automatically logged.  Company uses Device Information to improve the Mobile App and to make software updates, product support and other services more relevant to its users.</p>

  <p>The Mobile App may also use location services on your device to determine your approximate physical location (“Location Information”).  Company may collect and share Location Information and Device Information with our third party service providers to diagnose, analyze and correct software errors, to improve the Mobile App and to make software updates.</p>
